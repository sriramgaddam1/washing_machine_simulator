## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 🧱 Step 1: Open and Build in MPLAB X IDE

1. Open MPLAB X IDE.
2. Create a new project or import the existing source and header files.
3. Make sure the **XC8 Compiler** is selected.
4. Use **Clean and Build Project** (hammer icon) to compile.
5. This generates a `.hex` file inside the `dist/` directory.

### 🧪 Step 2: Simulate in PICSimLab

1. Launch **PICSimLab**.
2. Select the **PICGenios** board.
3. Choose **PIC16F877A** as the microcontroller.
4. Load the compiled `.hex` file.
5. Run the simulation and observe the output (via LEDs or components).
